# EyeWarning

This is my Undergraduate final year project. I had to build an android based drowsiness detection System using image processing concept.
I have developed a Smartphone based application which monitors the face of the driver in real time and alerts the driver when it finds closed/nearly closed eyes more than 2 seconds. I have used the front camera of the Smartphone to monitor the face of the user in real time. Drivers need to have mobile stands for vehicles to use the system in real world.


# Requirements

1. Hardware
- Android Device with minimum sdk 21
- Mobile stand for vehicles
2. Software
- download OpenCV Manager from google playstore
- Download shape_predictor_68_face_landmark.dat and store in internal storage of the android device
- Run the application

# What I used
- Opencv Library
- Dlib library
- Android Studio

# Implementation
